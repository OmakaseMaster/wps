      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Lorraine Yuan, a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM) division of SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell Tech, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Karan Girotra and Prof. Elena Belavina. I’m also a doctoral fellow at the Digital Life Initiative. I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Renmin University of China. I also hold a M.Eng. in Operations Research from Cornell Tech.

My research interests center on responsible AI adoption, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between data privacy and technology adoption in supply chain networks. I am passionate about exploring how AI-based technologies can transform the life cycle of data-driven decision-making—from data collection and privacy protection to the large-scale adoption of these technologies. I develop advanced privatization techniques and explore their applications in inventory management to enhance profitability and customer service while maintaining robust privacy protections. Additionally, I integrate advanced data-driven analytics to assess the impact of emerging technologies like Generative AI within production networks.

My research methodology combines data-driven optimization, machine learning techniques, network theory, and differential privacy algorithms.
